Ahoy hoy! I'm research physicist who is interested in the fundamental forces and elements of our Universe. To people who know the jargon, I'm an astroparticle phenomenologist. 

The mystery of dark matter has been the biggest driving force in my research to date. Dark matter is a component of the Universe that has been inferred from a whole host of experimental observations. This component is four times more abundance in the Cosmos than ordinary matter and it appears to be vital for the creation and survival of large scale structurs like galaxies. By consequence dark matter played an important role in creating the conditions for humans!  

Unsatisfied with this understanding physicists want to explain the deep nature of dark matter, like whether or not it can described as a fundamental particle, how it was created and why is it so abundant yet weakly interacting. The promising feature of this endevour is that many production mechanisms for dark matter require certain properties which are then testable.

Outside of physics I'm passionately about music. I have been in a few different bands over the years, but the pinneacle for me has to be creating the album with my friends in the Monroes, you can listen to our album on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/6n4GiAkPmmHKZVEuOYTfvh), [Apple music](https://music.apple.com/album/the-monroes/1313845700) or [YouTube](https://youtu.be/pkBb14WiB5c?si=wz03TuCJHsGREkAB).

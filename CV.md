### Positions of responsibility

**Referee in the peer review process:** I have acted as a referee for PRD and JCAP. 

**Royal Society Summer Exhibition 2017**: Main organiser for [modelling the invisible](https://www.modellinginvisible.org/) exhibit at the Royal Society, I was involved in every stage of the process, from application to the Royal Society to delivering the exhibit. Helped develop the software for the SuperCDMS replica and built and ran the website. I also undertook a day course in science communication at the Royal Society and gave a Seminar about it in Durham.

**Young Theorists Forum 9**: Main organiser for local event for PhD students, designed the poster for the event, organised the registration and indico website. Decided on who to invite to be a plenary speaker. Assisted in writing funding applications and chaired sessions. See website [YTF](http://maths.dur.ac.uk/YTF/9).

**Dark Matter from aeV to ZeV**: Organiser, ran one of the evening 'cultural events', the pub-quiz. Oversaw the audio-visual equipment in the conference room, ensuring all talks were ready before each session. See [event](https://conference.ippp.dur.ac.uk/event/555/overview).

**Young Theorists Forum 10**: Main organiser, oversaw the organisation of the event. Managed people on the committee ensuring the smooth running of the event and chaired sessions and ran the poster session, [see website](http://maths.dur.ac.uk/YTF/11).

**Diversity and Equality Committee** (2016-2017): Reside on a Physics department committee which focuses on improving the work environment in the department to encourage those from any walk of life to flourish. In this role I organised a training event about workplace harassment and micro-aggression.

**YETI 2019**: On organising committee, helped choose theme for event and invited speakers. See [event](https://conference.ippp.dur.ac.uk/event/723/).

**Postgraduate Student Staff Consultative Committee** (2016-2019): Reside on a committee to make postgraduate students' concerns and opinions known to members of staff within the Physics department.


### Outreach

**INFIERI Summer school at IFT Madrid** (Summer 2021): Co-wrote a 3 hour tutorial to give masters students a sense of what it means to search for dark matter. Developed the interactive part of the tutorial. [Event page](http://infieri2020.ft.uam.es/ciaff/general/ift-centre).
Open the binder link and wait for it to load (~2 mins).

**Particle Physics Masterclass** (2018): *The Z Boson at the ATLAS experiment*, talk to introduce students on how to detect particle events in LHC data. [see event page.](https://conference.ippp.dur.ac.uk/event/657/)

**Royal Society Summer Exhibition** (2018): Volunteer at national outreach event at the Royal Society, London,  [ghosts in the universe.](https://ghostsintheuniverse.org/)

**Green Man Festival Outreach Scientist** (2017): Volunteer with the UCL led group, *Quantum secrets of Photosynthesis*. Helped build the stand as well as engage with festival goers about physics.

### Other skills

**Coding**: Experience developing my own software using python and C, using novel computational techniques to perform multidimensional parameter reconstructions, details in [*JCAP* 1808 no. 011 (2018)](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2018/08/011/meta). Advanced knowledge of Python, C, bash, Linux, LaTeX, this includes data analysis packages such as pandas and scikit-learn. Experienced with Mathematica, CSS and html. Physics specific tools that I am familiar with include, FeynRules, FeynCalc, MadGraph, MadDM, MicrOMEGAS and AMUSE. Basic knowledge of ROOT, Julia and Fortran.

**Languages**: Native English speaker, intermediate level Spanish (Castellano), *very basic* French, Chinese Mandarin and British Sign Language.

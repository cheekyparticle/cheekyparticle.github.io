**Diversity and Equality Committee** (2016-2017): Reside on a Physics department committee which focuses on improving the work environment in the department to encourage those from any walk of life to flourish. In this role I organised a training event about workplace harassment and micro-aggression.

**YETI 2019**: On organising committee, helped choose theme for event and invited speakers. See [event](https://conference.ippp.dur.ac.uk/event/723/).

**Postgraduate Student Staff Consultative Committee** (2016-2019): Reside on a committee to make postgraduate students' concerns and opinions known to members of staff within the Physics department.
